_It's the Deep Blue Sea! Creating a Unity scene for Game Technologies._

My Unity scene is my rendition of the depths of the ocean, although with many creative liberties taken. For this project, I thought it would be a great opportunity to learn how to do 3D modeling and, while modeling furniture seemed easy enough and a good start, I really wanted to try modelling something more interesting to me. I thought that modelling a penguin would be both fun and easy so I went with that theme, but instead of being in the arctic, I wanted the scene to be at the bottom of the ocean so I could model a bunch of marine creatures. I also thought it was just a cooler atmosphere. As such, outside of the treasure chest, all of the objects I included were marine life of some kind. The scene as a whole wasn't really inspired by anything, but the giant anglerfish definitely took inspiration from the similar terrifying scene in _Finding Nemo_. However, I wanted all of my animals here to be generally calm and pacifist as I like the idea of coexisting life. I was also really attached to the idea of having an anglerfish be the light source since the Sun wouldn't reach the bottom of the ocean so a giant one worked out perfectly thematicallly. __The main character of this scene is definitely the penguin__ who seems to be looking for a sunken treasure chest.
